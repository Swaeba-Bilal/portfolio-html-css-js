# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a customized portfolio website created by **Swaeba Bilal** as part of the Java Development Course. The original template was provided during the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript module**, and I have customized the content to reflect my own learning, skills, and personal projects.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to help learners apply fundamental frontend development skills including:

- Structuring a website with **HTML**
- Styling it using **CSS**
- Adding interactivity using **JavaScript**

We were given a basic starter template that represented a fictional developer. My task was to personalize the portfolio to showcase **my identity, skills, and real academic projects**.

## 🛠️ What I Changed

I modified the template in the following ways:

- Replaced the name "Jane Doe" with **Swaeba Bilal**
- Updated the email and contact details
- Rewrote the **About Me** section to reflect my background as a Computer Science student
- Adjusted the **Skills** section to honestly describe the technologies I’ve practiced
- Updated the **Projects** section with real Java-based academic projects:
  - **Mood Tracker**
  - **Travel Planner App**
  - **Library Management System**
- Rewrote all **Recommendations** to reflect my actual course experience
- Customized the **CSS file** by changing:
  - Fonts
  - Padding
  - Colors
  - General styling to make it more personal and visually appealing
