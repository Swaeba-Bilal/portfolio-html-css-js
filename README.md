# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a customized portfolio website created by **Swaeba Bilal** as part of the Java Development Course. The original template was provided during the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript module**, and I have customized the content to reflect my own learning, skills, and personal projects.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to help learners apply fundamental frontend development skills including:

- Structuring a website with **HTML**
- Styling it using **CSS**
- Adding interactivity using **JavaScript**

We were given a basic starter template that represented a fictional developer. My task was to personalize the portfolio to showcase **my identity, skills, and real academic projects**.
